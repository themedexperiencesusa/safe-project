# SAFE Project - Task Log & Roadmap


## 2025-09-03 – MCC Email-Only Validation & Notifications

- Implemented resilient, email-only delivery flow in `Master Control Center/scripts/resilient_delivery_runner.py`:
  - Tries MCC `/alert/email` (Gmail OAuth), then `/v1/invoke send_email`, then optional SMTP fallbacks.
  - Retries each step twice with short backoff; writes JSON report to `data/reports/`.
  - SMS fallback is disabled by default; can be enabled with `--sms-fallback` or `MCC_SMS_FALLBACK=true` (kept off per current plan).
- Enhanced Gmail sender `Master Control Center/src/tools/send_email.py` for mobile-friendly alerts:
  - Added `from_name`, `reply_to`, `priority` (low|normal|high), `subject_prefix`, `body_html`, and custom `headers`.
  - Uses multipart/alternative when `body_html` is supplied.
- Created/retained diagnostics:
  - `Master Control Center/scripts/imap_diag.py` (IMAP 993 SSL login/search) and `scripts/smtp_diag.py` (SMTP 465/587 AUTH probe).
- Plan alignment (Phased):
  - Phase 1: Verify Gmail OAuth sends from MCC and all Master Exec agents to the user’s inbox with high-priority subjects/prefix.
  - Phase 2: Validate hosted server (IMAP/SMTP) once Gmail path is stable.
  - Phase 3: Consider sovereign SMS gateway (Asterisk/HTTP) after email paths succeed (no SIM required).

Next actions:
- Start MCC locally and run the resilient runner (email-only) to verify delivery; review `data/reports/` outputs.
- Add batch sender to iterate all Master Exec agents and send Gmail-based alerts with `[MCC ALERT]` prefix and `priority=high`.
- Configure a mobile mail rule to highlight prefix `[MCC ALERT]` for push reliability on device.

## Phase 1: Architectural Migration to Tauri/Rust

- [x] **Task:** Stand up the Tauri shell and Rust backend.
  - **Status:** Complete. `src-tauri` is initialized.
  - **Notes:** Replaces the previous Electron + Node.js architecture.

- [x] **Task:** Implement SQLite Event Log.
  - **Status:** Complete. `database.rs` module created, `log_event` command implemented and integrated.
  - **Notes:** This is the new foundation for all agent logging and state management.

- [x] **Task:** Implement Core Agent Runner & Archetypes.
  - **Status:** Complete.
  - **Details:** Created `agent_runner.rs` and the `Agent` trait. The runner can distinguish between `Service` and `Task` agents.

- [x] **Task:** Implement `PromptEngineeringAgent`.
  - **Status:** In Progress.
  - **Details:** Created `agents/prompt_engineering_agent.rs` with a placeholder implementation based on the blueprint. It correctly identifies as a `Task` agent.

- [x] **Task:** Integrate `PromptEngineeringAgent` into the Agent Runner.
  - **Status:** Complete.
  - **Details:** Updated `agent_runner.rs` to instantiate and run the `PromptEngineeringAgent`. Created a `run_task_agent` Tauri command in `main.rs` to expose it.

- [x] **Task:** Create documentation for Vegas Pool Coaches Park agents.
  - **Status:** Complete.
  - **Details:** Created `tasklog.md`, `testlog.md`, and `userguide.md` for `PoolAssessmentSpecialist` and `ClientManager` agents.

- [x] **Task:** Design and document the Super Business Agent Army.
  - **Status:** Complete.
  - **Details:** Created workflows and log files for `BusinessLawyerAgent`, `NotetakerAgent`, `SponsorshipAdvisorAgent`, `InvestorRelationsAdvisorAgent`, `StartupAdvisorAgent`, and `MasterCPAAgent`. Integrated them into the `VirtualOfficePark.md` blueprint.

- [x] **Task:** Design and document the Super Marketing & Sales Agent Army.
  - **Status:** Complete.
  - **Details:** Created a new `MarketingAndSalesPark` with 17 new agents, including `MarketStrategyAgent` (CMO), `DevilsAdvocateAgent`, and `DecoyClientAgent`. Each has a full set of workflow and log files. Integrated into the master blueprint.

- [ ] **Task:** Port `google-apis` Agent to Rust.
  - **Status:** Not Started.
  - **Details:** Create a `GmailAgent` as a `Service` agent that periodically checks for new mail using Rust crates like `yup-oauth2`. This will be a `Service` agent.

- [ ] **Task:** Port `node-cron` Agent to Rust.
  - **Status:** Not Started.
  - **Details:** Create a `SchedulerAgent` as a `Service Agent` using `tokio-cron-scheduler` to run tasks at specified intervals.

- [ ] **Task:** Build out the UI with Monaco Editor.
  - **Status:** Not Started.
  - **Details:** Develop the frontend UI to interact with the Rust backend, display logs from the SQLite DB, and provide an interface for managing agents.

- [ ] **Task:** Implement Telephony and Voice Integration (Project Chimera).
  - **Status:** Not Started.
  - **Details:** Create a `TelephonyAgent` to manage TextNow integration via web automation (Playwright) and bridge audio to STT/TTS services.

- [ ] **Task:** Begin real-life workflow testing.
  - **Status:** Not Started.
  - **Details:** Start with the `PromptEngineeringAgent`. Create a simple UI test harness to send a goal and context, and verify the returned optimized prompt.
